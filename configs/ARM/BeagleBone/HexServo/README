
This configuration is based on HexServo and drives standard CNC milling 
machines with 3-5 axis driven by AC/DC servo motors.
High-speed low-jitter step/dir pulse generation is achieved by the use
of PRU.

There are currently no limit switches configured, so adjust the MIN_LIMIT
and MAX_LIMIT axis settings in the ini file if your printer has less than
200 mm of X/Y travel.  If you have limit switches, uncomment the marked
lines in the HAL file to enable them.

Current X and Y settings are appropriate for a typical "MendelMax" style
printer, with the following settings:

max vel   = 200 mm/s
max accel = 3000 mm/s/s
scale     = 80 steps/mm

Adjust as required for your machine.  Make scale negative to invert any
axis that is moving 'backwards'.
